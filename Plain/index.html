            <h5>Why we are building Plain API-first</h5>
            <div class="preLast_txt">
                <p>Over the last decade, engineering infrastructure across virtually every company area has become more
                    advanced: Payments, communications, data, and so forth. What used to take teams in high-growth
                    companies entire quarters to accomplish now takes individual engineers a few days.</p>
                <p>This shift has happened in every area but customer service. There, the choice remains between
                    maintaining a patchwork of hacks, fighting the rigid structures of established platforms, or wiring
                    together cloud call centre solutions and building homegrown ticketing systems.</p>
                <p>We are building Plain to change this - to make great customer service, at every scale, plain and
                    simple.</p>
